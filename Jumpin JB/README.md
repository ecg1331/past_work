**Help JB the cat catch the treats** and level up by using the arrow keys to move **⬅️ LEFT**, **➡️ RIGHT**, and **⬆️ JUMP**! <br>
Be careful to **avoid the tacks**, they will pop your balloons <br>
If you do pop a balloon, try to catch another one as they float by <br>
Once you have popped all your balloons, the game is over <br>
The treats and tacks will increase as you move through the levels

**Extra Tips:**
🫧 Catch the bubbles to be shielded from tacks until the bubble pops! 🫧 <br>
🐱 Hit the spacebar to hear JB's (real) meow 🐱

🐾 **Good Luck!** 🐾
