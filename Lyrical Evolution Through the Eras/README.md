# Lyrical Evolution Through the Eras

This project explores the thematic evolution of an artist's musical catalog over time. Using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, lyrical data is analyzed to uncover patterns in thematic and stylistic changes across different albums.

## Project Overview
- Organized lyrical data into a structured dataset, pairing lyrical snippets with their corresponding albums.
- Transformed text data into numerical formats using TF-IDF vectorization to enable effective analysis and classification.
- Implemented machine learning models to classify lyrics by album and uncover thematic patterns, including:
  - **Decision Trees**
  - **K-Means Clustering**
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Truncated SVD**
- Created visualizations to interpret patterns in lyrical evolution and model performance.
