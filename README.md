<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Emma</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am currently a Masters student in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago</h3>

This is an example of some of my past coding work, as detailed on my resume.
<br>
This Repo contains: <br>
-`Lyrical Evolution Through the Eras` <br>
    - This folder contains code developed for a machine-learning project aimed at classifying an artists' text lyric data to the corresponding albums. Although this was done for a class project, I continued to work on it after the class ended and made significant improvements to the decision tree and logistic regression models by optimizing the train test split ratio and continuing to hypertune parameters.<br>
    - [Video presentation of original models here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fPmn6hGo1cZZg9i0ix8f2uSX2BnSArHA/view)
- `gs_prototype.ipynb` improved upon Google Scholar scraper developed for a [final project](https://github.com/macs30122-winter24/final-project-aepy)
- `td_requests_elect_years.ipynb` - code developed to analyze the relationship between government take down requests and election years
