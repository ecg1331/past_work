<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Emma</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am currently a Masters student in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago</h3>

This is an example of some of my past coding work, as detailed on my resume.
<br>
This Repo contains:
-`Lyrical Evolution Through the Eras'
    - Folder containing all code done for a machine-learning project where I tried to get various models to classify text lyric data to correct albums.
    - Although this project was for a class, I continued making improvements on the models after the class ended. I have improved the performance of the logistic regression models and the decision trees by increasing stop words and lowering the testing data ratio.
    - [Video presentation of original models here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fPmn6hGo1cZZg9i0ix8f2uSX2BnSArHA/view)
- `gs_prototype.ipynb` improved upon Google Scholar scraper developed for a [final project](https://github.com/macs30122-winter24/final-project-aepy)
- `td_requests_elect_years.ipynb` - code developed to analyze the relationship between government take down requests and election years
