<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Emma</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am currently a Masters student in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago</h3>
This is an example of some of my past coding work, as detailed on my resume.

### This Repo contains:
#### Lyrical Evolution Through the Eras
- This folder contains code developed for a machine-learning project aimed at classifying an artist's text lyric data to corresponding albums.
- Although this was done for a class project, I continued to work on it after the class ended and made significant improvements to the decision tree and logistic regression models by optimizing the train-test split ratio and continuing to hypertune parameters.
- [View the final presentation of my original models here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fPmn6hGo1cZZg9i0ix8f2uSX2BnSArHA/view)

#### gs_prototype.ipynb
- Improved upon Google Scholar scraper developed for a [final project](https://github.com/macs30122-winter24/final-project-aepy)

#### td_requests_elect_years.ipynb 
- Code developed to analyze the relationship between government take-down requests and election years
